##Hello, I'm Mark.

Technologist at heart. Successfully unlocked my left-right brain dynamics by building great products while bringing order to chaos. 

I just finished my master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University. I am currently part of Quixey, Search Engine Company for Apps - working with Product Management and Business Operations.

Before this, I worked as Project Manager and Analyst, also launched my own venture to sharpen my business & product sense.

I enjoy traveling, photography, and anything that gives adrenaline rush. I'm love underwater hockey (yes, it's a sport!) and 5x marathon finisher.

As of the moment, there's a lot of great ideas in my head that are driving me insane. I think I need a conversation therapy.
